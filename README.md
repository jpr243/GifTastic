GifTastic is a Motorsport Champions themed GIF generator

How to use
______________________________________________________________________________

Users may click on one of the buttons labeled with the title of a motorsport champion to view ten relevant GIFs from GIPHY.

If a user wishes to see GIFs of a motorsport champion that does not already have a button, they can create a new button by filling out 
and submitting the form on the right portion of the screen. After doing so, the user can click on the newly created button to generate GIFs for their favourite motorsport champion.

The program initially displays the GIFs as still images. To toggle an image between its still and animated states, the user needs to click on the image.
